# Machine Learning Internship - CodeAlpha Tasks
This repository highlights the projects I completed during my machine learning internship. Each project is organized in its directory, containing detailed Jupyter notebooks and a README file to provide a thorough understanding of the methodologies and outcomes.


**Projects Overview**


**1. Credit Scoring Model**

Developed a predictive model to assess creditworthiness using historical financial data. The project employs various classification algorithms and evaluates the model's accuracy and performance through metrics and analysis.


**2. Emotion Recognition from Speech**

Implemented a deep learning-based recognition system to identify emotions from audio speech inputs. The project explores feature extraction techniques and neural network architectures tailored for audio processing.


**3. Disease Prediction from Medical Data**

Built a model to predict the likelihood of diseases based on symptoms and patient history. This project processes labeled medical records using classification algorithms to forecast potential health risks effectively.


**Technologies and Skills**

Data Preprocessing: Cleansing, normalization, and transformation to prepare datasets for analysis.
Model Development: Applied machine learning techniques including SVM, Random Forest, and neural networks.
Performance Evaluation: Utilized metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess model efficacy.
Visualization: Created intuitive plots and charts to present data and results clearly.



This collection reflects hands-on experience in solving real-world problems with machine learning, showcasing a blend of technical expertise and analytical insights.
